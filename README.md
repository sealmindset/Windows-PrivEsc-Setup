# Windows-PrivEsc-Setup

Forked from Tib3rius for setting up a Windows 10 for running through the privilege escalation exercises.

As of 1809, Windows Defender keep quarantining the exploit binaries. 

Created a simple batch (PowerShell) script to disable Windws Defender and SmartScreen.  NOTE: Need to be local admin on the box to run.
